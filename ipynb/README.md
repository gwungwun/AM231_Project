## IPython Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks that details the procedure to setup datasets and learn DMMs. It is a good starting place
for working with the model. The running example here is a randomly generated toy dataset. 

* [Setup](DMM-Setup.ipynb) : Setup for datasets and learning DMMs
* [Reloading Models](DMM-Reload.ipynb) : Reloading models from saved checkpoints 
* [Visualizing the Learned Model](DMM-Viz.ipynb) : Visualizing training and validation results as well as samples from the model 
* [Polyphonic Music](DMM-Midi.ipynb) : Listening to samples from a DMM trained on the polyphonic music dataset 

The above is a reasonable starting place to get started on training and inspecting the model with your own data.
